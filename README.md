# Pneumonia Detection using DenseNet121 and Grad-CAM

This project provides a graphical application for detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images using a fine-tuned DenseNet121 model.  
The interface allows loading an X-ray image, running inference, and visualizing the model’s attention using Grad-CAM.
